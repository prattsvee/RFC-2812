# IRC Server and Client

## Overview

This project implements a basic version of an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server and client based on the RFC 2812 specification. It allows multiple clients to connect to the server, join channels, send messages, and perform other IRC-related commands.

## Files

- `server.c`: Contains the source code for the IRC server. It handles multiple client connections, channel management, and message forwarding.
- `client.c`: Contains the source code for the IRC client. It connects to the IRC server, sends commands, and displays messages from the server.
- `Makefile`: Used to compile the server and client programs easily.
- `client.conf`: A configuration file for the client that contains the server IP address and port number.
- `README.md`: This file, containing information about the project and how to run it.

## Compilation

To compile the server and client, use the provided Makefile:

```bash
make


./server

./client

OR DO IT MANUALLY

gcc -w  server.c -o server
./server

gcc -Wall client.c -o client
./client


This README provides a basic guide to what each file in the project is for, how to compile the programs using the Makefile, and how to run the server and client manually.
